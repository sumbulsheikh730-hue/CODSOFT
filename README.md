These projects helped me strengthen my basic Python skills and understand how to apply programming concepts in real situations. Each task was a small but meaningful step toward improving my logic, coding style, and confidence with Python.

Task 1 – Simple Calculator:
Designed a calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The program takes user input and displays results clearly.
Learned to use match-case statements and error handling to make it user-friendly.

Task 2 – To-Do List:
Created a simple program to add, update, and delete tasks.
Users can mark tasks as complete or pending.
Helped me understand how to use loops, lists, and file handling.

Task 3 – Rock, Paper, Scissors Game:
Built a fun game where the user plays against the computer.
The computer makes random choices using the random module.
Program decides who wins and can keep score for multiple rounds.
Improved my skills in conditionals, loops, and logic building.
